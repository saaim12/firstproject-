      <h1>Brahma Chicken: All You Need To Know - Colors, Eggs, and More</h1>
      <p>
        The Brahma is a massive chicken and is only rivaled by the Jersey Giant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their size and intimidating appearance, they are gentle giants.
      </p>
      <p>
        They make a wonderful addition to any flock and even help to defend the
        flock against smaller predators.

    <p>The Brahma is a striking bird to look at.
        Whilst their head and brow gives them a fearsome look, nothing could be further from the truth.
        
        This placid bird gets along with everyone and can become attached to their owners. They are very good with kids just watch out for them being knocked over by these humongous birds.
        
        Just make sure you keep them well fed and you will have a happy chicken.
        
        They are a good breed for those wanting to raise their own eggs and meat birds since they can supply both in great quantities.

      The Brahma chicken was one of the ultimate table birds until the rise of
      industrial birds in the 1930s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they fell from industry favor they remained popular with small
      flock keepers as they are a dual purpose hen. She is one of the largest
      chicken breeds and has a beautiful plumage which only adds to this special
      breeds appeal. Despite their size they are a very gentle chicken that is
      well suited for beginners or families.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are better in cooler climates and thrive in the northern states where
      the weather can be brutally cold. Another nice thing with Brahmas is the
      fact that they prefer laying over the cooler months. They will lay right
      through the winter and slow down as spring starts to arrive. Great timing
      since other breeds will be just starting to lay.
